Pinia best practices, common gotchas, and state management patterns.

### Store Setup
- Getting "getActivePinia was called" error at startup → See [pinia-no-active-pinia-error](reference/pinia-no-active-pinia-error.md)
- Setup stores missing state in DevTools or SSR → See [pinia-setup-store-return-all-state](reference/pinia-setup-store-return-all-state.md)

### Reactivity
- Store destructuring stops updating UI reactively → See [pinia-store-destructuring-breaks-reactivity](reference/pinia-store-destructuring-breaks-reactivity.md)
- Store methods lose context in template calls → See [store-method-binding-parentheses](reference/store-method-binding-parentheses.md)

### State Patterns
- Filters reset on refresh or can't be shared → See [state-url-for-ephemeral-filters](reference/state-url-for-ephemeral-filters.md)
- Building production app without DevTools or conventions → See [state-use-pinia-for-large-apps](reference/state-use-pinia-for-large-apps.md)
